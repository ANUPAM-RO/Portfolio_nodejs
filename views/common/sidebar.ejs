        <p>My name is Anupam roy.It is said that “student life is golden life,” because student life is the most important part of human life. It is the period of pure joy and happiness, because the mind of a student is free from cares and worries of a grown-up life. ... The primary duty of a student is to learn and to acquire knowledge.</p>
